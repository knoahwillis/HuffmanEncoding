# HuffmanEncoding

Huffman coding in C++ for my Information and Coding Theory independent study.

Usage:

```sh
make
./Huff
```  
To test with your own text or files, either replace the `original.txt` file with one of your own or copy-paste your text into the file. Then, make sure to clear `outputEncoded.txt` and `outputDecoded.txt` to ensure no collisions occur with the currently encoded text.
